I initially made this for a CS2110 homework project, but I've continued to update the game with additional features I didn't have time to implement in the week and a half I was given on the homework.

The game uses GBA mode 3, which provides bitmapped backgrounds and a sprite object block. The enemies, projectile, player, and runner obstacles are sprites, while the background graphic, ground, and text are done via drawing pixels to the screen.
